    <p>Cacio E Pepe is a simple, but filling pasta made with cheese and black
    pepper.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1-2 Servings of your choice of long pasta (Spaghetti or Linguini
      preferred)</li>
      <li>1/3 Cup of Parmigiano Reggiano Cheese, Very Finely Grated</li>
      <li>1 1/2 Teaspoon of Whole or Crushed Black Peppercorns</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Toast peppercorns in an pan without oil or anything for a few minutes
      until fragrant.</li>
      <li>Salt and boil pasta water.</li>
      <li>When your pasta water comes to a rolling boil, cook pasta until
      al dente.</li>
      <li>Half-way through cooking the pasta, ladel some pasta water to cover
      black peppercorns in the other pan.</li>
      <li>Take another ladel of pasta water and mix it into your bowl of finely
      grated Parmigiano Reggiano Cheese. Mix well until it becomes a liquid
      paste. Set aside for now.</li>
      <li>Once pasta is al dente, trasnfer into pan with the black peppercorns
      and pasta water.</li>
      <li>Turn off heat and mix in the liquid cheesy paste.</li>
      <li>Mix well until emulsified with pasta. If the sauce starts to break
      (the oil separating from the cheese and pasta water), add a little bit of
      pasta water and start mixing lightly again.</li>
      <li>Plate your pasta, and finish off with a little bit of freshly cracked
      black pepper and a dash of cheese.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
