    <p>
      A quick and light pasta made with Garlic (aglio) and Oil (olio).
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1-2 Servings of your choice of long pasta (Spaghetti or Linguini preferred)</li>
      <li>5-7 Garlic Cloves (depending on size of individual cloves)</li>
      <li>1-1 1/2 Tablespoon Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
      <li>1 Tablespoon of Salt</li>
      <li>5-7 Sprigs of Fresh Parsley</li>
      <li>(Optional) Dried Red Pepper Flakes (Gochugaru preferred)</li>
      <li>(Optional) Parmigiano Reggiano Cheese (Whole Block preferred)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil half a pot of water.</li>
      <li>Slice all garlic cloves as thin as possible. Some variation in slices 
      is ok.</li>
      <li>Seperate parsley leaves from the sprigs. Chop finely.</li>
      <li>Pour the extra virgin olive oil on to a cold pan.</li>
      <li>Start heating pan slowly on low heat.</li>
      <li>If the water is at a rolling boil at this point, pour salt into water
      and wait an additional 1 minute.</li>
      <li>Boil pasta to al dente (normally 3-4 minutes less than what is listed
      on the packaging).</li>
      <li>Put garlic slices onto the pan, turn heat up to medium-low.</li>
      <li>Lightly cook garlic until garlic is taking on some color. If the 
      garlic starts to cook too rapidy/fast, pour in 1/3 cup of pasta water to 
      stop the cooking process.</li>
      <li>(Optional) Add in your red pepper flakes at this point and mix around
      with the garlic.</li>
      <li>Once pasta is al dente, trasnfer pasta into garlic oil sauce mixture.
      Reserve 1 cup of pasta water.</li>
      <li>Start combining pasta with garlic oil sauce, add in some pasta water
      gradually as you see the oil not clinging to the pasta. Chances are
      you'll most likely use only 1/3 of the reserved pasta water.</li>
      <li>Once sauce is combined with pasta, turn off heat, add your chopped
      parsley and give it a mix.</li>
      <li>Plate your pasta, and optionally at this point, you can top it off
      with some grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
